# Data-Mining-Assignments
Some code up on GitHub!

This is a simple distance metric calculator for dataset containing income data.
The code is not the most efficient. I was adamant on using Python for this particular assignment as it has a great amount of flexibility.

Another point of interest is that, the code is not super efficient. I have used numpy arrays to store data since it is super fast to carry out operations on numpy arrays. However, I did mess up while reading from the csv file. This will be fixed in the next set of code.
